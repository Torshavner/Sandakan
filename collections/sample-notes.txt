Lecture Notes: Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval.
Instead of relying solely on parametric knowledge, RAG systems retrieve relevant
documents from a vector store and use them as context for generating answers.

Key Components:
1. Document Ingestion - Extract text from PDFs, split into chunks, generate embeddings
2. Vector Store - Store embeddings in a database like Qdrant for fast similarity search
3. Retrieval - Given a user query, find the most relevant chunks via cosine similarity
4. Generation - Feed retrieved context to an LLM to produce grounded answers

Production Best Practices:
- Use semantic chunking to preserve meaning boundaries
- Set a similarity threshold to filter low-quality matches
- Implement token budget management to stay within context limits
- Monitor retrieval quality with relevance scores
- Use conversation history for multi-turn interactions
